# Gyroscope STM32F407VG & LQG control (or Arduino)
This is the code for control system of gyroscope based self-balancing system using STM32F4 discovery KIT, generated by MST32CubeMX using HAL library in KeilC or IAR for ARM.

My folders only contain the source code and you can regenerate the whole programming files by running the ".ioc" files on STm32CubeMX. All of the peripheral setups can be found in the ".ioc" files. The code can be easily comprehenced by reading the user code sections in the "main.c", "main.h" and the interrupt file.

I also upload another version of hardware in the Src folder which runs by arduino, and is placed in the Arduino folder. Please ignore those folder in the Src if you only want to work with STM32F4.
