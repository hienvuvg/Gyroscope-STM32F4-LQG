# Gyroscope STM32F407VG & LQG control
This is the code for control system of gyroscope based self-balancing system using STM32F4 discovery KIT, generated by MST32CubeMX using HAL library in KeilC or IAR for ARM.

My folders only contain the source code and you can regenerate the whole programming files by running the ".ioc" files on STm32CubeMX. All of the peripheral setups can be found in the ".ioc" files. The code can be easily comprehenced by reading the user code sections in the "main.c", "main.h" and the interrupt file.
